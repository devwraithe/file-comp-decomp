** Smaug and Bilbo **
Smaug: "Well, thief! I smell you, I hear your breath, I feel your air! Where are you?"
Bilbo: "O Smaug! Chiefest and greatest of calamities"
Smaug: "Do you think flattery will keep you alive?"
Smaug: "My teeth are swords! My claws are spears! My wings...are a hurricane!"

** Smaug and Bard **
Smaug: "Who are you that will stand against me?"
Smaug: "Now, that is a pity. No help will come!"
Smaug: "Is that your child? You cannot save him from the fire, he will burn!!!"
Smaug: "So tell me wretch!"
Smaug: "How now shall you challenge me? You are forsaken!"
